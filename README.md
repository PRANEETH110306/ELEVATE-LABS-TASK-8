# TASK 8: Indian Mythology Blog – Responsive Website Using Bootstrap 5

This project is a fully responsive blog page created using **Bootstrap 5**, dedicated to showcasing the stories of Lord Vishnu's Dashavatara, Top Mythological Stories, and cultural trivia. It includes a custom layout, clean design, and thematic content for Indian mythology lovers.

## About the Project

I started this blog layout by referring to a **basic Bootstrap layout from YouTube**, but as it didn’t meet my visual or structural expectations, I gradually modified it with the help of AI to suit my needs.

This turned out to be one of the most **complex but interesting UI projects** I’ve worked on, where I explored and experimented with:

- Grid systems
- Custom card behavior
- Navigation menus
- Responsive layouts
- Font and design aesthetics

---

## Key Features

- Responsive **Navbar** with brand and links (Home, About, Contact)
- **Dashavatara section** using cards (10 avatars of Lord Vishnu)
- Each card links to a **separate HTML page** with full avatar details
- Custom **Top Stories** column on the right with blog snippets
- **Mythological Trivia**, **Shlokas**, and **Yuga Information** added
- Hover effects and glowing transitions on cards
- **Social Media icons** included in the footer
- Separate `styles.css` used for custom styling (as Bootstrap alone wasn’t sufficient)
- Only few **Shlokas** added and reused them again, as it was difficult to find and alisn them
- First time I have used **Comments** this time, as it was difficult to search for something and change them
- Works for other devices, like- Mobile and Tablet devices

---

## Tools Used

- **HTML5**
- **Bootstrap 5 CDN**
- **Font Awesome** (for social icons)
- **Custom CSS** (`styles.css`)
- **VS Code** (for development)

## Notes & Learning

- Sometimes, Bootstrap defaults don’t match the exact visual needs — that's where **custom CSS** was necessary.
- Positioning cards and aligning columns side-by-side with responsiveness was tricky but fun.
- Learned how to **override Bootstrap components**, use **utility classes**, and apply **hover transitions** properly.

---

## How to Run

1. Download and save all the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Make sure images are placed inside the `/images` folder.
4. Click on any card to go to another tab or page to know the content.

---

## Wanted to Add (Future Improvements)

- Working navbar
- Clickable Top Stories and right column content
- Navbar logo and image for navigation
- Search bar functionality
- Back-to-top button
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)

## Final Thoughts

This turned out to be one of the most **complex but interesting UI projects** I’ve worked on. I realized early that without a proper guide or design notes, achieving layout precision becomes difficult. Maintaining visual references, layout notes, or wireframes can greatly help in building structured Bootstrap designs like this one.
